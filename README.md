# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis using Machine Learning

This project focuses on analyzing the red wine quality dataset and building predictive ML models using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.

## 📊 Dataset Description
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Features**:
  - Fixed Acidity, Volatile Acidity, Citric Acid, Residual Sugar
  - Chlorides, Free & Total Sulfur Dioxide, Density, pH
  - Sulphates, Alcohol
- **Target**: Wine Quality (score 0–10)

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Analyze correlations between features and quality
- Evaluate impact of alcohol, acidity, sulphur dioxide
- Build ML models to predict wine quality
- Compare performance of Decision Tree vs Random Forest

## 🧠 ML Models Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📈 Performance Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Feature Importance

## 📂 Files Included
- `Wine_Quality_Analysis.ipynb` – Main analysis notebook
- `Wine_Quality` - Dataset
## 📸 Visualizations
- Heatmap of correlations
- Boxplots & Scatterplots
